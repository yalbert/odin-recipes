                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Pan frying salmon in a hot pan is one of my favourite ways to eat salmon, and this recipe 
                    is one I make often for myself. 
                </p>
                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4 (5-ounce) center-cut salmon fillets (about 1-inch-thick), skin on or off</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Directions:</h3>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring the salmon to room temperature 10 minutes before cooking.</li>
                        <li><p>Warm a large nonstick skillet with oil over medium-low heat. Season the fish with salt and pepper. 
                            Raise the heat to medium-high. Place the salmon, skin-side up in the pan.</p>
                            <p>Cook until golden brown on 1 side, about 4 minutes. Turn the fish over with a spatula, and cook until it feels firm to the 
                            touch and the skin is crisp if desired, about 3 minutes more.</p> </li>
                        <li><p>The skin can be served or removed easily with a knife or spoon.</p> </li>
                        <li><p>Transfer to a plate and serve as desired.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
